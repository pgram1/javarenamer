# javarenamer

This utility batch renames directories in a directory by adding some text.

Usage: `java -jar renamer.jar [directory] [added text]` (jar [here](https://github.com/pgram1/javarenamer/releases/latest))

## Why

This can be used to mask out some resource directories of various program files, to test the automatic handling of localization as well as the absence of libraries.
